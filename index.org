- GOI was found screening for plants with altered boron response
- In a GFP-NIP5;1 population /goi/ mutants showed sustained GFP signal under mild boron concentration
  - Mutations mapped to GOI gene

** Questions about GOI
{{{class(long)}}}
   1) Does it have RNA-endonuclease activity?
      - Is it capable of degrading total RNA?
   2) Is GOI's activity is related to the events of ribosome stalling?

** Chapter conclusions
{{{class(long)}}}
- Post pyDegradome classification improved the list of degradation signals detected on candidate genes
- Degradation signals on /NIP5;1/ were dependent on GOI and found closer to AUG-STOP sequences. This suggest a link between GOI's endonuclease action and ribosome stalling.
- Comparison between Degradome and CAGEseq data point to a specific regulation by GOI in the context of increases in boron concentration
- Focus on degradation signals around exon-junctions suggest a novel link between miRNA398 and GOI
** General conclusions
{{{class(long)}}}
1. Is it capable of degrading total RNA??
   - Evidence of that GOI_{SMR} had RNA-nuclease activity was presented

2. Is GOI's activity is related to the events of ribosome stalling?
   - Degradation intermediates on NIP5;1 were found close to AUG-STOP sequences  known to be associated with ribosome stalling; this in a GOI-dependent manner.

- RNA-endonuclease activity remains to be proved:
  - Use of specific probes: Flourescent-based method
  - Expression in heterologous systems (e.g. Yeast)
- Confirmation through RACE-PCR is needed (Initial attempts suggest these are true signals)
