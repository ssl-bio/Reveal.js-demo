# Reveal.js presentation written in emacs org-mode + org-reveal
## Description

[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) is a tool for creating HTML presentations and [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/) is an emacs package that converts org files into reveal.js-compatible HTML format. Although org-reveal greatly simplifies the process of creating a presentation, some modifications are necessary. The code shows such modifications using as example part of the presentation used for my PhD. thesis dissertation.
